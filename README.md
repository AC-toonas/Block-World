# Welcome to BlockWorld!
This game is inspired by Minecraft and Terraria!
Game is currently in ALPHA release version!
In this game, you have multiple blocks you can build with. You also have a character, which is a little ball with an eye. A world spawns around you with trees, lakes, and other structures! You can freely explore and build in the world!
Currently in ALPHA release, expect many bugs. The game is also really boring but please try it out!
