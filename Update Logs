v0.1 — Initial prototype
- Created main loop and window (pygame init, display mode).
- Added a basic game entry point (infinite loop calling start menu and run_game).
- Implemented a single-tile grid render routine (basic fill/draw).

v0.2 — Basic blocks & constants
- Introduced BLOCKS dictionary (IDs → names).
- Added block ID constants (GRASS, DIRT, WOOD, etc.).
- Added DELETE constant for toolbar delete slot.
- Added SOLID_BLOCKS set for collision checks.

v0.3 — Image assets & scaling
- Added file-loading for block images from repo (e.g., `grass.png`).
- Added player images (`player.png` and `player-eyeclosed.png`) and scaled them.
- Implemented safe check for missing images (only load if present).

v0.4 — World sizing and layout
- Added configuration for blocksize, base_cols/base_rows and world_multiplier.
- Computed screen dimensions, view height, world_cols and world_rows.
- Added world bounds clamping for player and camera.

v0.5 — World generation (grass baseline)
- Implemented `generate_world` returning an all-GRASS world for basic start.
- Added `area_is_clear` helper used by later generators.

v0.6 — Lakes & trees generation + presets
- Added randomized lake generation (square water pools).
- Added randomized tree generation (WOOD trunk + LEAVES neighbors).
- Introduced world generation presets: `normal`, `crowded`, `free`.
- Tuned `lake_count` and `tree_count` per preset.

v0.7 — Player movement & collision
- Implemented player position, movement with WASD/arrow keys.
- Added hitbox (`HITBOX_SIZE`) and `solid_at` collision checks.
- Added normalized diagonal movement (vector normalization).
- Added camera following player (centered viewport).

v0.8 — Player rendering polish
- Added player blink animation (blink_timer, blink_interval, blink_duration).
- Added player rotation to face mouse cursor (angle calculation & rotate blit).
- Added center-drawing of player sprite.

v0.9 — UI: Start menu and UI basics
- Implemented start menu with title and version display.
- Added Play buttons: Survival and Creative.
- Added world preset selection UI (Normal, Crowded, Free).
- Added fonts for title, buttons and small text.

v1.0 — Toolbar UI & slot system
- Implemented toolbar drawing at bottom (toolbar height, slots).
- Added `build_toolbar_slots` to populate toolbar slots (creative vs survival rules).
- Added visual highlights for selected and hovered slots.
- Added keyboard hotkeys (1–9) to select toolbar slots and `X` for delete.

v1.1 — Creative mode & placement
- Creative: allowed instant placing of any block selected from the toolbar.
- Creative toolbar lists all blocks (except void).
- Placement in creative writes selected block into world immediately.

v1.2 — Survival mode basics & inventory
- Added `inventory` mapping for block counts.
- Survival toolbar only shows blocks with inventory > 0 plus DELETE slot.
- Right-click placement in survival consumes inventory and only places on GRASS or WATER.
- Added selected_block initialization differences (DELETE for survival, GRASS for creative).

v1.3 — Mining system & progress
- Introduced mining behavior: hold left mouse to mine mineable blocks.
- Added `mineable` set (WOOD, LEAVES, STONE, BRICK, DIRT).
- Added mining progress tracking (`mine_target`, `mine_progress`, `MINE_TIME`).
- Added mining completion: increase inventory and set mined tile to GRASS.
- Added on-screen mining progress bar while mining.

v1.4 — Placement rules and deletion
- Implemented DELETE toolbar slot to replace a block with GRASS.
- Enforced survival placement constraints (inventory check).
- Handled mouse button logic for placement and mining (mousedown/mouseup).

v1.5 — Options menu & toggles
- Added options button in-game (three-dot button).
- Implemented options menu with:
  - "Quit & New Game" (returns to menu)
  - "Better Grass" toggle that flips `better_grass_enabled`
- Hooked options menu visibility to a toggled state.

v1.6 — Visual polish & grass tinting
- Added `tint_image` helper to generate `grass_dark`.
- Implemented `better_grass_enabled` behavior to use `grass_dark` for grass tiles.
- Improved toolbar visuals and inventory counts overlay (small font).

v1.7 — Rendering optimization & viewport culling
- Optimized draw loop to only render visible tile rectangle (start_row/start_col → end_row/end_col).
- Clamped camera to world pixel bounds to prevent out-of-range drawing.

v1.8 — Misc improvements & edge-case handling
- Added robust coordinate checks for hovered cell and tile indices.
- Added safety checks in `area_is_clear` to avoid placing lakes/trees near edges.
- Fixed player bounds clamping to world pixel dimensions.
